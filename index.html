        <p>Here are a few labels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cyber Engineer</li>
            <li>Programming Enthusiast.</li>
            <li>Game Designer</li>
            <li>Audio Producer</li>
          </ul>

         <p>I graduated from UTSA in 2020 for cyber-security. Cyber-security has always been a field I wanted to be a part of since I was a little boy. Computers have always been a mystery to me so I used college as the change to delve into them. Since grauation I have interned with a local startup where I recieve mentoring to further my computer science studies by developing a project of my choosing. My passion is music and gaming, so I made it my quest to recreate and develop a Digital Audio Workstation (like garageband!) With the right guidance I've chosen SuperpoweredSDK to develop my personal project. I am currently employed as a Cyber Engineer and am working on CompTIA Network+ & Azure certificates.</p>

          I call my DAW project the "audioBuilder", composed of three parts.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The processor, coded in c++. Use CPU to modify audio file (.mp3) </li>
            <li>The Controller, coded in JS. Running on Node env, the controller makes calls to the processor and store files in /tmp/ </li>
            <li>The View, coded in JS with React / Redux and something called Fusion.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          As you can see, it's pretty much MVC except the model is audio. All parts communicate with eachother using JSON. Repositories posted to github. </p>

        <p>
          This project has been almost two years now in the making! I'm currently fixing time delay effects on the audioBuild exec whilst getting a grasp of front-end development. These skills will be put to use for pen-testing, so I can deploy my own servers / websites and use Kali Linux to test for vulnerabilities.
